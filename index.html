                <h3>iFrame</h3>
                   An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. 
                   It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page . They are commonly used for 
                   advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.
                <q></q>
                <h3>q Element</h3>
                    The <q> HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation.
                     Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. 
                     This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; 
                    for long quotations use the < blockquote > element.
                    example:
                    <p>WWF's goal is to: 
                            <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q>
                            We hope they succeed.</p>
                
                <h3>Blockquote</h3>
                The blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source. 
                Content inside a blockquote must be quoted from another source, whose address, if it has one,
                may be cited in the cite attribute. If the cite attribute is present, 
                it must be a valid URL potentially surrounded by spaces.
                
                <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
                For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. 
                The world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in 
                100 countries and is supported by 1.2 million members in the
